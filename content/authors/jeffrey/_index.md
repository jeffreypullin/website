I am currently a Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) student at the University of Melbourne. I am writing my thesis on statistical problems in single cell RNASeq data, under the supervision of [Davis McCarthy](https://www.svi.edu.au/research_themes/bioinformatics_and_cellular_genomics). I also work part time as a research assistant in the [Wayne Crismani's Lab](https://wcrismani.wixsite.com/research) at the St Vincents Institute of Medical Research. 

Previously I worked as a graduate at the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare](https://www.aihw.gov.au/) in their statistical support team. 

I completed my BSc (Mathematics and Statistics) at Melbourne Unversity in 2018. During the third year of my degree I worked as a research assistant in the [Bioinformatics Division](https://www.wehi.edu.au/research/research-fields/bioinformatics) of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research as part of the Undergraduate Oppurtunites Research Program.
