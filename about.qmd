Hi, welcome! A little about me:

Currently, I am working as a Senior Analyst/Statistician at the Victorian Agency for Health Information, part of the Victorian Department of Health.

Later this year, I will start a PhD in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Dr Chris Wallace. My project will focus on improving statistical methodology for performing colocalisation analysis in genetics, with a particular focus on the 'coloc' software.

Previously, I completed a Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) at the University of Melbourne. My thesis, supervised by Dr Davis McCarthy, compared different statistical methods for selecting genes that distinguish biological cell-types in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. I won the Dwight Prize in Mathematical Statistics as the highest-scoring student in the statistics and stochastic processes specialization in the MSc.

Before that, I worked as a graduate at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and as a part-time research assistant in Wayne Crismaniâ€™s Lab at the St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research. I completed my BSc (Mathematics and Statistics) at the University of Melbourne in 2018.

In my spare time, I like to run, read and do cryptic crosswords, with the hope of one day finishing a DA cryptic...
